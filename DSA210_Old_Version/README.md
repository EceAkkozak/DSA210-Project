# DSA210-Project


# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to examine the relationship between public transportation data and traffic density data in Istanbul. By examining this data, we aim to reach potential connections that can provide valuable suggestions for urban planning and transportation in a crowd city like Istanbul. Data will be collected separately for each month from 2024 and both datasets will be accessible from the Open Data Portal of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality.

-Do public transport and traffic density progress inversely or directly proportional to each other?
-Are public transport and traffic independent of each other, showing mass independence?
-Are their day-to-day changes parallel?


# Motivation
With its dense population and optional public transportation system, Istanbul frequently comes to the agenda with the problems it causes to people in terms of transportation. Accurately observing traffic density and public transportation usage and finding the correlation between them can help in offering potential solutions for the solution of the traffic problem of this metropolis. Sustainable urban transportation strategies can be determined by monitoring potential density fluctuations.


# Objectives
- To analyze the relationship between public transport ridership and traffic density in Istanbul.
- To identify patterns in which increases or decreases in public transport use correspond to changes in traffic congestion.
- To assess the effectiveness of public transport in alleviating traffic congestion during peak hours and seasons.
- To provide actionable insights for urban planners and transport authorities to optimize public transport schedules and routes.


# Tools and Technologies
To analyze the data, the following tools and technologies will be used:

Python: Programming language for data processing, analysis, and visualization.
Libraries: Pandas (data manipulation), Matplotlib/Seaborn (visualization), Scikit-learn (for potential machine learning models).
Excel: For initial data inspection and cleaning if necessary.
Google Colab: An alternative platform for running Python code with cloud access.
GitHub: For project documentation and code sharing


# Expected Outcoome
The expected outcomes of this project include identifying patterns and relationships between public transport usage and traffic density in Istanbul, especially during peak hours and seasons. We aim to provide suggestions on how public transport can reduce traffic congestion, offer recommendations to optimize transport schedules, and suggest areas for improving public transport coverage. The analysis will also help visualize the impact of transport policies and provide data-driven ideas for urban planning and sustainability efforts.
