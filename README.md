# DSA210-Project

##

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing the relationship between weather conditions and traffic density in Istanbul. 
Using hourly data from January 2024, the study investigates how environmental factors such as temperature, precipitation, humidity, windspeed, and visibility influence average traffic speed. 
As Istanbul is a densely populated metropolitan area, understanding how weather impacts traffic flow can provide valuable insights for urban mobility planning and infrastructure resilience. 
The dataset includes hourly weather records and traffic intensity metrics, merged and cleaned for analysis. Basic statistical tests and machine learning models are used to quantify the strength of these relationships and to forecast daily average speeds under varying weather conditions.

## Motivation
Istanbul frequently struggles with traffic congestion, often worsened by unpredictable weather patterns. By uncovering the statistical links between atmospheric conditions and traffic performance, this project aims to support smarter, data-driven traffic management strategies. In the long term, these insights can aid city authorities in making informed decisions to mitigate congestion, especially during adverse weather conditions.

## Objectives
- To explore the correlation between hourly weather variables and traffic indicators.  
- To determine which environmental factors most significantly impact average vehicle speed.  
- To develop a predictive model for daily average speed based on weather and traffic data.  
- To provide recommendations for integrating weather forecasting into urban traffic planning.

## Tools and Technologies
The analysis was conducted using:  
- **Python** for data processing, analysis, and visualization  
- **Pandas** for data manipulation  
- **Seaborn/Matplotlib** for exploratory data visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** for linear regression modeling  
- **Jupyter Notebook** (via Anaconda) for interactive development  
- **GitHub** for code versioning and sharing  

## Expected Outcome
This project is expected to reveal how weather variations affect traffic flow in Istanbul and to what extent these factors can be used to predict average daily speed. By visualizing patterns and building a basic linear regression model, the study seeks to generate actionable insights for municipal transportation departments. These findings may support the design of weather-adaptive traffic control systems and help reduce congestion through anticipatory planning.
